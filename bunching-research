# BUNCHING

## What is bunching?

Bunching = successive vehicles on a route arriving closer together than they are scheduled to.

## How do you know when bunching is happening?

- Bunching is usually defined via thresholds.
  - Example: if two buses are less than half the scheduled headway apart, they are considered "bunched."
- Metrics are usually headway-based:
  - Standard deviation of headways
  - Coefficient of variation of headways
  - Percentage of passengers affected by bunched service
- Instead of using fixed thresholds (e.g., "buses less than 50% of scheduled headway apart"), some sources now use dynamic thresholds based on real-time traffic, demand, or scheduled variability.

## How does bunching happen?

- **Route Instability**:
  - If a bus is delayed slightly (traffic!), it will probably pick up more passengers at future stops because those people had to wait longer, increasing the duration of each stop event and causing further delays.
  - Meanwhile, the next bus picks up fewer passengers because they all were waiting on the previous bus. This next bus now goes faster, with shorter stop events, and is likely to catch the delayed bus.
  - This negative feedback loop leads to bunching.
- **Demand-side**:
  - Variability in passenger demand disrupts scheduled headways.
- **Supply-side**:
  - Traffic congestion, signal delays, and inconsistent driver behavior contribute to irregular bus intervals.
- **Operations**:
  - Problems such as initial dispatching errors and inappropriately scheduled frequency intervals (should xyz bus actually run more/less often?).

## How has bunching been addressed in the past?

- **Schedule fixes**:
  - Adjusting timetables and implementing holding strategies at stops to maintain regular headways.
- **Real-Time fixes**:
  - Utilizing GPS and other technologies to monitor bus locations and dynamically adjust operations.
- **Infrastructure Improvements**:
  - Implementing dedicated bus lanes and signal priority systems.
  - Providing exclusive rights-of-way to insulate buses from traffic.
- **Dynamic Waiting Times**:
  - Holding buses at stops when gaps become too small; conversely, deploying spare buses when gaps become too large.

## Consequences of bunching

- Increased waiting times and overcrowded buses diminish service reliability and user satisfaction.
- Bunching leads to uneven workload distribution among buses:
  - Some buses are overcrowded while others are underutilized.
