# Questions Document

This document is for adding and tracking questions related to our project.

## Initial Questions

- Does time variance of a shuttle route affect the ridership of a line? (Is the ridership correlated to the variance?)
- Do multiple routes experience increased time variance in the same/similar stops? (i.e. Is there possible bottleneck in the routemap?)

Leah:
1. How do waiting times and shuttle headways vary by time-of-day across different routes?
2. Do stops in high-traffic areas exhibit significantly different waiting patterns compared to stops in less busy areas?
