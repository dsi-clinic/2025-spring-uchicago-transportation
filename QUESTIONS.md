# Questions Document

This document is for adding and tracking questions related to our project.

## Initial Questions

Minjae:
- Does time variance of a shuttle route affect the ridership of a line? (Is the ridership correlated to the variance?)
  - Scatter Plot
- Do multiple routes experience increased time variance in the same/similar stops? (i.e. Is there possible bottleneck in the routemap?)
  - Hard. wait.

Leah:
- How do waiting times and shuttle headways vary by time-of-day across different routes?
  - Too broad (focus in more)
- Do stops in high-traffic areas exhibit significantly different waiting patterns compared to stops in less busy areas?
  - Flag for "high traffic area"

Kristen: 
- Which shuttles have the lowest and highest ridership on average? 
- What is the average duration of trips across each route (from the first stop to the last stop); is there a lot of variance here too?
- Which stops on each route have the longest average stop duration?

Luna:
- How does weather impact average shuttle ridership across routes and weekdays?
- Does ridership spike during exam weeks or major campus events?
- Are UChicago shuttles more heavily used for morning arrivals or evening departures?
- Are there repeating “micro-patterns” within the day (e.g., strong 8am & 5pm peaks)?
