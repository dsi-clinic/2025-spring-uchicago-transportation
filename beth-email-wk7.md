Hi Beth, 

Thank you for your help with our project so far! We'd like to first share some high-level takeaways with you, and then a few questions we have as we seek to wrap this quarter up. 

We'd like to focus on [x number] conclusions: 
1) We addressed issues with the variance explorer page that we showed you on 4/29. For example, the NightRide routes now have their correct times accounted for (the 15 minute intervals from 4p-11p is accounted for separately from the 30 minute intervals from 11p-4a, etc). Because the behavior of many of the routes is now much closer in line with expectations after these edits, the most interesting takeaway from this page is that the Downtown Campus Connector still has standard deviations between 16-22 minutes depending on the stop, and median wait time between 22 minutes (Goldblatt) and 41 minutes (Gleacher). The DCC's deviation from expectation is greater than the rest of the routes. We can definitely continue to do more work surrounding the DCC to understand why this may be the case. 
2) Continuing analysis of the same page, the South route also exhibits weird behavior. The other NightRide routes that similarly operate (North, East, Central) each have similar behavior in their 15 and 30-minute intervals; that is to say, they all come about every 15 minutes when they're supposed to, and every 30 minutes when they're supposed to. But for South, the 15-minute window has an observed median ranging from 20 minutes @ Woodlawn & 61st to 26 minutes @ 63rd & Ellis. (The 30-minute window does have all of its stops under a 30 minute average wait time, which makes for an interesting discrepancy.)
3) An interesting observation from our analysis (on the riders waiting patterns by stop page) is that some non-holdover stops have longer stop durations compared to holdover stops. For instance, on the South route, Cottage Grove & 60th, Woodlawn Ave & 63rd, and Booth all have longer stop durations than Logan Center, a known holdover stop. Similarly, on the Red Line/Arts Block route, Garfield & Wabash has a longer stop duration than Garfield Red Line/Logan Center, which is a holdover stop.
4) There are more riders in the middle of the week than on Monday or Friday. Less students are coming to or leaving campus during the final week. And bunching rate is the highest during 9 AM and 5 PM. For 9 AM, nealy for every 8 shuttles there will be one bunch.
5) We have started investigation on the headway patterns of downtown connector shuttle, which we expect to be able to provide a dashboard tool which you can use to easily monitor the bunching(headway shorter/longer than scheduled) in a selected time bracket at a specific stop. While we will delve into the bottlenecks in the line with the current data, this would allow the transportation team to utilize the tool with newer datasets in the future as well.

We also have a few questions for you as we look to expand on this work: 
1) We talked on 4/29 about the influence that Via has had on NightRide ridership. We wanted to look at a year-over-year analysis to see what the change in ridership has been and see the impact that Via has had. To that end, is there stop event data from last academic year (9/1/2023-7/2024) or more data from this academic year (9/1/2024-5/2025)? It would be a very good apples to apples comparison if we could have something like that.
